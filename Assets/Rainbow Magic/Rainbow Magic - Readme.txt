F.A.Q.
------------------

Q I think this pack is missing something  This pack doesn't have an effect like this

A If you have any suggestions for additional content, feel free to send me an e-mail.

Q My impact effects rotation is odd!

A Some of the impact effects default rotation is set to impact at a floor.
This means you will have to script the impact effect to be rotated according to the surface direction.

Q Missile trails are not displaying in Scene view?

A This is a bug which happens in some versions of Unity 2017.3, consider upgrading your project!
